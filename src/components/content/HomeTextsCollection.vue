          [2021-04] <strong>Onion URL Update</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <em>This message affects all users accessing FoxMixer using Tor.</em>
          <br /><br />
          FoxMixer has a new Tor onion v3 URL<br />
          <strong>
            <a href="http://foxmixer4dw2zluv7gy4pgqrpp2ab6p323s5clcyt7i5csbpk2pzezid.onion">
              foxmixer4dw2zluv7gy4pgqrpp2ab6p323s5clcyt7i5csbpk2pzezid.onion
            </a>
          </strong>
          <br />
          Store it in your bookmarks, it is now the preffered way accessing FoxMixer through Tor<br />
          The advancements in the Tor development make this step necessary, as the old, shorter v2 URL format (foxmixer6mrsuxrl.onion) has been
          <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline" target="_blank">deprecated by the Tor team</a>.
          <br />
          The old onion URL will still stay available. But since July, you are most likely not able to reach FoxMixer using the old URL after updating to the latest version of Tor.
          <br />
          Pay close attention to store this URL correctly, to avoid being tricked by fake websites.
          <br /><br />
          This change does not affect the clearnet domain (https://www.foxmixer.com) in any way, which will stay available as usual.
